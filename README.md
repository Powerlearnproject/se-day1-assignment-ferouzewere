#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the systematic use of engineering ideas, methods, and tools to create and maintain high-quality software systems. It includes the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The development of programming languages: through managing complexity, improving code reusability, and standardizing practices, fostering more complex and scalable software solutions.
- The establishment of software engineering as a discipline: led to standardized practices, improved quality, professional practices, innovation, and better communication, encouraging the growth.
- The rise of agile methodologies encouraged iterative development, improving teamwork, and allowing for quick response to changes, which increased project efficiency and responsiveness.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user and system specifications.
  - Design: CraftingÂ detailed designs for the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and developing software in accordance with the design specifications.
  - Testing: Running numerous tests to confirm that the software fulfils quality and functional criteria.
  - Deployment: Making the software available to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing continuing software support, updates, and enhancements following deployment.
    
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall is a linear, step-by-step approach to software development in which each phase must be completed before the next can begin. Agile is an iterative, flexible methodology that emphasises ongoing input and responding to change throughout the project.

- Waterfall is appropriate for projects with defined, constant needs, such as building a bridge or developing software for regulatory compliance. Agile is suitable for projects where the needs may change, such as producing a mobile app or a startup product.

- The main distinction is that Waterfall is inflexible and sequential, whereas Agile is fluid and adaptive, allowing for adjustments even later in the project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer: Writes code and implements software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Creates and executes test programs to ensure software quality.
  - Project Manager: Responsible for the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that include tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools that track changes to source code and coordinate teamwork (e.g., Git).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements might change during the development cycle, causing scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: The pressure to produce software solutions on time can lead to hasty development and reduced quality.
  - Technical Debt: trade-offs in the codebase to achieve faster delivery can affect future development attempts and raise maintenance expenses.
  - Strategies to overcome: Effective communication, agile techniques, work prioritisation, and continuous evaluation of project goals and timeframes are all examples of challenge-overcoming strategies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  - Unit testing is the process of testing individual software components or modules.
  - Integration testing involves evaluating relationships between various components or subsystems.
  - System testing is the process of testing the entire software system.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user criteria to ensure it satisfies their needs.
The importance of quality control: Code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration are all examples of quality control procedures that help detect and repair flaws early in the development process, resulting in higher-quality software.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is creating inputs for AI systems that yield best results.
- It makes it easier for clients to get relevant results from the first prompt.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: "Everything about a dog"
Improved prompt: "Describe dog breeds and their corresponding physical traits"
